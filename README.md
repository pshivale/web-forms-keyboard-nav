### Easy navigation through the form fields on a web page using keyboard arrow keys

This javascript allows you to navigate easily through the fields of a form in a web page fluidly by using keyboard arrow keys. It makes it very easy to navigate between the fields using arrow keys giving you the feeling of a native console app. It is especially useful when there are plenty of fields to fill out in a form.

#### Quick Start

Include jquery script and [keyboard-nav.js](html/javascript/keyboard-nav.js) into your html page and you are all done.
